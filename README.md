# __GymStore__

The goal of this project is to create an e-commerce webpage that allows users to create buying orders. Users can navigate through the site and choose products to buy as they 
please. This project aims to create a real environment like that of a shopping site.

This virtual store has a profile section area which allows users to become members and save information about their purchases. You can also buy without having the need to 
become a member of the store. In the making of this project CRUD functionality where programmed in python.

In future updates, the goal is to make the store already in real mode, selling products and making payments and not only in a demo enviroment. One other more ambitious update is 
that the store will be available in other languages, this will make it possible to expand the branch of clients that visit the store. This is the fourth ms4 project from Code Institute.

## __The purpose of the GymStore is to :__

+ Create an online commercial store where people can have access to buy products for exercise and nutrition.

+ Create an environment of commerce that assimilates as much as possible to reality.

+ Today online shopping is more common than before. The sale of products from different areas has become a lifestyle. Which opens a way to competition between different companies.

The idea of ​​making this online store was born from the ms4 project for Code Institute. The inspiration for this site comes from the Swedish site [gymgrossisten](https://www.gymgrossisten.com/).


### __Project Strategy__

To meet the goal of this project, the following strategy has been implemented.

+ Provide CRUD functions are included making it possible for the user to handle their information.

+ The site is built to easy navigate and this makes it also easy to use.

+ A secure checkout page where user can see a detailed list of their products

+ A registration section thus giving the option of being able to track purchases by sending emails

### __Design__

__Color Scheme__

The colours that I used for the site:

* (Black) Background color of all system templates. 

* (White) For the titles in the navbar, and for the texts in the other templates of the website such as buttons, product descriptions, etc.

* (Blue) Is used by the text box where the visa card number is placed on the checkout page

* (Green) Is the default color of the buttons in the checkout page. Also the hover color for the view button in the all product page.

* (Red) It is used for the "shop now" button and the text of the card purchase.

* (Grey) is the hover color for the add to cart button in the all product page and the color main color for the button in the product detail page.

The reason why these colors were chosen is because since the background color is black. It was necessary to use strong colors that contrast with the environment. This contrast allows the user to be more focused 
on what they need and also gives at the same time a typical atmosphere of the gym world. Since in most of these sites and from the site in which this project was inspired, the main background color is black.


### __Typography__

"Roboto" and Sans-Serif font has been used in the website. The reason why this font was chosen is because it makes the text of the site more clear. Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. Roboto also allows letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes the reading rhythm to be more natural.
    
### __Imagery__

The images used for the creation of this project were taken from the Swedish website [gymgrossisten](https://www.gymgrossisten.com/). The picture in the home page is from pexels.com. The reason for this choice is that being an online store for exercise products, it is important that the first impression of the user when entering is to understand what the site is about. 
The images taken from the gymgrossisten page are only use as images of the products available in the online store.
